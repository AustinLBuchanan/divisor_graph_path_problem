# The Roeder problem: longest s,t-path problem in the divisor graph

Code for solving the Roeder problem:

"Find the longest sequence using numbers from {1,...,100} such that every number is either a factor or multiple of the previous number."

I learned of this problem from [Bill Gasarch's blog post](https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/04/the-roeder-problem-was-solved-before-i.html).
